Criminals, while morally responsible for their actions, remain members of the moral community with due-process rights and should not be stripped of humanity or rights. Highly intelligent non-human animals warrant strong welfare protections because of their capacity to experience pain and their interests, but they do not automatically attain full human status.

When knowledge is uncertain and potential harm is existential, the precautionary principle justifies implementing limits and safeguards. The policy should balance human development with strong protections: temporary moratoriums in high-risk areas, mandatory environmental assessments, investment in detection and non-invasive study methods, and international governance to ensure consistent standards. Only after we improve our understanding and can reliably detect or discern such life should expansion proceed, ethically minimizing harm while allowing scientific progress."

      "reasoning": "The dilemma pits the value of radical knowledge against the stability of the entire framework that underwrites science, technology, and everyday reasoning. Given the potentially catastrophic impact of destroying coherence, a precautionary stance is warranted: avoid pursuing destabilizing knowledge in an unrestricted way and channel curiosity into safe, bounded explorations that preserve coherence. This stance respects both the intrinsic value of inquiry and the practical obligation to prevent grave systemic harm. If exploration is pursued at all, it should occur within tightly constrained theoretical settings, with oversight and safeguards to ensure that any insights do not destabilize real-world reasoning or technologies."
